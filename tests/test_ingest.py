Unit tests for scripts/ingest.py — parser, assembler, and schema shape contracts.

These tests exercise _parse_content_list and _assemble_paperjson against the CI fixture
(tests/fixtures/sample_content_list.json) without requiring a GPU or MinerU installation.

Run with:  python -m pytest tests/test_ingest.py -x
